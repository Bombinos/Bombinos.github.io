                                    I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong scientific background and a creative mind. During my previous career in biotechnology, I began to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because it was fun and challenging. As I continued to dig deeper into learning to write code, I realized that I would be better capable of serving the community and caring for my two boys, while also enjoying a more personally fulfilling career, if I made the switch to Web Development.  I am certain that this is the career path that I want to take. Through patience, repetition, and study, I have grown and matured in my knowledge and skill set. I am very optimistic about my future as I continue to learn and understand more about this exciting field. I will never stop learning and growing as a web developer and I believe that the best way to accelerate this goal is to share my potential with the right employer.
